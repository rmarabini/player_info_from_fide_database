# FIDE Ratings Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts to download, store, and query FIDE chess player ratings from the FIDE database. The first script downloads and processes a list of FIDE players, storing their information in an SQLite database. The second script queries the database and outputs player records based on input FIDE IDs.
